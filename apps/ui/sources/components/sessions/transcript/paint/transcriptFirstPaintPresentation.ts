/**
 * Single presentation-policy owner for the transcript first-paint placeholder.
 *
 * The placeholder is a genuine loading state (UD-3): it covers only content that is not yet
 * presentable, it clears at the earliest presentable frame, and every fact that can hold it has a
 * terminal path. Concealing later movement is explicitly not its purpose, so no producer
 * settlement join (Mermaid/Pierre/held-scroll) participates here.
 *
 * Rules encoded below, in evaluation order:
 * - a loaded, empty transcript is terminal — it shows its empty state, never a placeholder;
 * - the single bounded deadline reveals with a named fallback outcome; it never claims the paint
 *   or placement it was waiting for actually happened;
 * - an entry whose painted rows this policy already revealed is never covered again. Covering a
 *   first paint is a loading state; covering rows the reader is already looking at is a blink,
 *   which is the defect the placeholder exists to prevent. That record only latches from an
 *   uncovered frame, so it answers the SWR shape where the data lands after the rows painted;
 * - painted rows outrank every fact that cannot show the reader something WRONG. A cover may
 *   only sit above them when revealing would present content at a position the reader never
 *   asked for (a keyed anchor restore, a native paint-at-A -> restore-at-B write) or with its
 *   text not yet renderable (the web Markdown runtime renders its raw fallback hidden). Waiting
 *   for a landing that only refines an already-correct position is holding presentable content
 *   to conceal later movement, which is exactly what this placeholder is not for;
 * - the web bottom-entry landing therefore covers only the pre-paint window. Legend paints the
 *   tail entry from `finishInitialScroll`, so the entry's own first paint is already at the
 *   position the landing refines; its remaining write is a settle, not a placement, and its
 *   affirmative terminal is a renderer confirmation the renderer cannot always produce;
 * - rows that already painted stay visible while their session refreshes (cached/SWR content is
 *   never re-covered by route hydration).
 *
 * `firstListPaintObserved` is the web Legend renderer's `onLoad`, and on that renderer it is a
 * PAINT fact, not a settle fact: @legendapp/list 3.3.3 emits `onLoad` from the same block that
 * flips `readyToRender`, and its row container is styled `opacity: readyToRender ? 1 : 0`
 * (`react-native.web.mjs`, `setInitialRenderState` / `ContainersInner`). Mounted rows are
 * therefore invisible until it fires, so DOM row presence is not evidence the reader can see
 * anything and must never be substituted for this fact - that would uncover a transparent list.
 * `paint/legendWebRowVisibility.real.integration.test.tsx` pins both directions of that coupling.
