 * How many attention rows the initial page carries.
 *
 * Unlike the active family's bound, this one *binds*: the reference account has 938 sessions with an
 * attention reason against ~2,900 sessions. It is nonetheless a bound and not a truncation, and the
 * difference is the ordering. The attention family is read with `V2_SESSION_LIST_ORDER_BY` — the
 * list page's own key — so it is a filtered subsequence of the list itself, and the rows above the
 * cap are exactly the rows the cursor page reaches at a later position. Ordinary pagination
 * backfills every one of them, which is why the family needs no cursor and no has-next of its own.
 *
 * The active family has no such property (`lastActiveAt` orders it, and a session can be live with
 * its last meaningful activity weeks old), so a row *it* omits has no other path into the list and
 * its limit is set above any plausible count instead. Pinned by
 * `v2SessionListInitialPage.attentionRows.sqlite.integration.spec.ts`, which fails if the attention
 * read ever stops sharing the page's ordering — at which point this cap becomes silent data loss.
 *
 * The cap counts the rows the *response* carries as attention rows, so attention rows the page
 * already holds spend it too: it bounds the family, not the number of statements' worth of rows read.

 * qualify through any of them, so no index on any engine can serve it: every engine drops the whole
 * OR into a residual filter and reads the account's sessions. `Session.needsAttention` materializes
 * the same answer as a single **equality** key, so
 * `[accountId, needsAttention, meaningfulActivityAt desc, id desc]` serves this predicate *and* the
 * `V2_SESSION_LIST_ORDER_BY` this read is issued with, leaving the `take` to bound the work. Serving
 * the ordering is the load-bearing half: a filter-only fact makes the engine sort every matched row,
 * which costs more than the filter saves for an account with more attention rows than the limit.
 *
 * The column is **database-generated** from the four raw columns, so no writer of any version can
 * leave it stale and this seek is complete on its own: it needs no dual read and no reader repair.
 * `isDurableAttentionRow` still narrows the result in memory — the failed-turn arm additionally
 * requires a primary-session runtime issue *and* a session that is still active or still unread —
 * which is a stricter product rule layered on top of the predicate, not a second answer to it. It
 * has to be layered rather than folded in: a generated column may reference only same-row columns
 * and cannot parse the `lastRuntimeIssue` JSON portably across PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite.
 *
 * `archivedAt IS NULL` deliberately stays its own conjunct rather than becoming a fifth arm of the
 * generation expression: it filters an already-tiny matched set, and folding it in would make every
 * archive/unarchive rewrite the generated value and, on PostgreSQL, the row.
 *
 * `derived` is that predecessor predicate, kept for exactly one reader: a binary that is ahead of
 * `prisma migrate deploy` and whose primary read already failed because the column does not exist.
 * Its unindexable scan is not a regression there — it is what that schema's own binary did, and no
 * `[accountId, needsAttention, …]` index exists on it to lose. This is not a dual read: the hot path
 * never issues it, and it answers a *missing column*, never a stale one. It must name no column the
 * legacy projection had to drop, which `v2SessionListPage.projectionFallback.spec.ts` pins against
 * the fallback column list itself.
 *
 * The two unread branches are the two halves of `seq > COALESCE(lastViewedSessionSeq, 0)`: SQL
 * compares a never-viewed session against NULL, which is not true, so it needs its own branch.
